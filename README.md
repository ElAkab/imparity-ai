# **Imparity AI**

## Overview

**Imparity AI** is an app that helps you **weigh the pros and cons** of any topic using **artificial intelligence**. By analyzing arguments from both sides, it delivers a **balanced and impartial conclusion**.

With the interface, you can:

* Enter a **topic or question**
* Add **pros and cons** arguments
* Run an **AI-powered analysis** for a neutral, reasoned summary

---

## Learning Goals

This project started as a **developer experiment** to explore how AI can be integrated into web applications. It’s a hands-on way to understand:

* Front-end and back-end logic
* API communication with an AI model
* Structuring a small but complete web project

## Technologies Used

| Type                | Tool / Technology                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI / LLM**        | [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) with **Gemma 3** model |
| **Front-end**       | HTML, TailwindCSS v4.1, JavaScript                  |
| **Back-end**        | Node.js / Express                                   |
| **API**             | Local AI integration via Ollama                     |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub                                        |

## How It Works

1. Enter a **topic or question**
2. Add arguments **for** and **against**
3. The AI model analyzes and reformulates the arguments via Ollama
4. Receive a **balanced summary and conclusion**

---

## Project Status

🔧 **Work in progress**
The core logic and AI integration with **Gemma 3** are underway. The current focus is to develop a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** before refining the UI and user experience.

---

## Next Steps

* [ ] Improve prompt handling for better AI responses
* [ ] Design a more intuitive interface
* [ ] Save and review past analyses
* [ ] Compare multiple topics
* [ ] Experiment with other AI models for reasoning differences

---

## Conclusion

This project is a **learning journey** in AI and web development. Beyond improving my **full-stack skills**, it explores the interaction between human input and AI reasoning. There’s also potential for it to evolve into a SaaS product in the future.
