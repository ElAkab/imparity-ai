# **Imparity AI**

## Project Overview

Let me present to you the **Imparity AI** app😎. An application where you can **weigh the pros and cons** of any topic using **artificial intelligence**. _There’s no better way than AI to assess arguments fairly and reach an intelligent, just, and impartial conclusion._
The goal is to produce a **balanced analysis** and an **objective conclusion**, based on an AI model capable of examining both sides of an argument before summarizing the reasoning.

The interface allows users to:

* Enter a **topic or question**,
* Add **pros and cons** arguments,
* Run an **AI analysis** to generate a neutral, well-reasoned conclusion.

## Learning Goal

As a **developer eager to learn**, I created this project to experiment with bringing AI into web applications, 
a way to **understand how to connect an AI model with a web interface** and make them communicate effectively.

Through this project, I’m exploring:

* Front-end and back-end logic,
* API communication with an AI model,
* The structure of a small but complete web project.

## Technologies Used

| Type                | Tool / Technology                                                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AI / LLM**        | [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) with **Gemma 3** model                    |
| **Front-end**       | HTML, TailwindCSS v4.1, JavaScript                                     |
| **Back-end**        | Node.js / Express                                                      |
| **API**             | Local AI integration via Ollama                                        |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub                                                           |

## How It Works

1. The user enters a **topic** or question.
2. They add arguments **for** and **against**.
3. The system sends this data to the AI model through Ollama.
4. The AI processes and analyzes the arguments, reformulates them, and produces a balanced summary and conclusion.

## Project Status

🔧 **Work in progress**
The project is currently in development. I’ve started experimenting with **Ollama** and the **Gemma 3** model, but the full interface and logic are still under construction.

The short-term goal is to create a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** before refining the design and improving user experience.

## Next Steps

* [ ] Improve prompt handling for better AI responses
* [ ] Design a more intuitive and user-friendly interface
* [ ] Add a feature to save and review past analyses
* [ ] Allow comparisons between multiple topics
* [ ] Experiment with other AI models for reasoning differences

## Conclusion

This project is primarily a learning journey exploring how AI can be integrated into web applications.
However, I also see potential for it to evolve into a SaaS product in the future.
Even if the code is not perfect yet, it’s helping me **understand the relationship between human input and AI reasoning**, while growing my **full-stack development skills**.
